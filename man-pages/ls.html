<p>LS(1) General Commands Manual LS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ls &acirc; list directory contents</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ls [-@ABCFGHILOPRSTUWabcdefghiklmnopqrstuvwxy1%,]
[--color=when] <br>
[-D format] [file ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
For each operand that names a file of a type other than
directory, ls <br>
displays its name as well as any requested, associated
information. For <br>
each operand that names a file of type directory, ls
displays the names <br>
of files contained within that directory, as well as any
requested, <br>
associated information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no operands are given, the
contents of the current directory are <br>
displayed. If more than one operand is given, non-directory
operands are <br>
displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are
sorted <br>
separately and in lexicographical order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-@ Display extended attribute
keys and sizes in long (-l) output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Include directory entries
whose names begin with a dot (&acirc;.&acirc;) <br>
except for . and ... Automatically set for the super-user
unless <br>
-I is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Force printing of
non-printable characters (as defined by <br>
ctype(3) and current locale settings) in file names as xxx,
<br>
where xxx is the numeric value of the character in octal.
This <br>
option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008
(&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Force multi-column output;
this is the default when output is to <br>
a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D format <br>
When printing in the long (-l) format, use format to format
the <br>
date and time output. The argument format is a string used
by <br>
strftime(3). Depending on the choice of format string, this
may <br>
result in a different number of columns in the output. This
<br>
option overrides the -T option. This option is not defined
in <br>
IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Display a slash
(&acirc;/&acirc;) immediately after each pathname that is a
<br>
directory, an asterisk (&acirc;*&acirc;) after each that is
executable, an at <br>
sign (&acirc;@&acirc;) after each symbolic link, an equals
sign (&acirc;=&acirc;) after <br>
each socket, a percent sign (&acirc;%&acirc;) after each
whiteout, and a <br>
vertical bar (&acirc;|&acirc;) after each that is a
FIFO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Enable colorized output. This
option is equivalent to defining <br>
CLICOLOR or COLORTERM in the environment and setting <br>
--color=auto. (See below.) This functionality can be
compiled <br>
out by removing the definition of COLORLS. This option is
not <br>
defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Symbolic links on the command
line are followed. This option is <br>
assumed if none of the -F, -d, or -l options are
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Prevent -A from being
automatically set for the super-user. This <br>
option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008
(&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Follow all symbolic links to
final target and list the file or <br>
directory the link references rather than the link itself.
This <br>
option cancels the -P option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O Include the file flags in a
long (-l) output. This option is <br>
incompatible with IEEE Std 1003.1-2008
(&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;). See <br>
chflags(1) for a list of file flags and their meanings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P If argument is a symbolic
link, list the link itself rather than <br>
the object the link references. This option cancels the -H
and <br>
-L options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Recursively list
subdirectories encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Sort by size (largest file
first) before sorting the operands in <br>
lexicographical order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T When printing in the long
(-l) format, display complete time <br>
information for the file, including month, day, hour,
minute, <br>
second, and year. The -D option gives even more control over
the <br>
output format. This option is not defined in IEEE Std <br>
1003.1-2008 (&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Use time when file was
created for sorting or printing. This <br>
option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008
(&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W Display whiteouts when
scanning directories. This option is not <br>
defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Include directory entries
whose names begin with a dot (&acirc;.&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b As -B, but use C escape codes
whenever possible. This option is <br>
not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008
(&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Use time when file status was
last changed for sorting or <br>
printing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--color=when <br>
Output colored escape sequences based on when, which may be
set <br>
to either always, auto, or never.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">always will make ls always
output color. If TERM is unset or set <br>
to an invalid terminal, then ls will fall back to explicit
ANSI <br>
escape sequences without the help of termcap(5). always is
the <br>
default if --color is specified without an argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto will make ls output escape
sequences based on termcap(5), <br>
but only if stdout is a tty and either the -G flag is
specified <br>
or the COLORTERM environment variable is set and not
empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">never will disable color
regardless of environment variables. <br>
never is the default when neither --color nor -G is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For compatibility with GNU
coreutils, ls supports yes or force as <br>
equivalent to always, no or none as equivalent to never, and
tty <br>
or if-tty as equivalent to auto.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Directories are listed as
plain files (not searched recursively).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Print the Access Control List
(ACL) associated with the file, if <br>
present, in long (-l) output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Output is not sorted. This
option turns on -a. It also negates <br>
the effect of the -r, -S and -t options. As allowed by IEEE
Std <br>
1003.1-2008 (&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;), this option has no
effect on the -d, -l, <br>
-R and -s options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g This option has no effect. It
is only available for <br>
compatibility with 4.3BSD, where it was used to display the
group <br>
name in the long (-l) format output. This option is
incompatible <br>
with IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h When used with the -l option,
use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, <br>
Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte in order to reduce
the <br>
number of digits to four or fewer using base 2 for sizes.
This <br>
option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008
(&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i For each file, print the
file&rsquo;s file serial number (inode <br>
number).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k This has the same effect as
setting environment variable <br>
BLOCKSIZE to 1024, except that it also nullifies any -h
options <br>
to its left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l (The lowercase letter
&acirc;ell&acirc;.) List files in the long format, as <br>
described in the The Long Format subsection below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Stream output format; list
files across the page, separated by <br>
commas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Display user and group IDs
numerically rather than converting to <br>
a user or group name in a long (-l) output. This option
turns on <br>
the -l option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o List in long format, but omit
the group id.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Write a slash
(&acirc;/&acirc;) after each filename if that file is a <br>
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Force printing of non-graphic
characters in file names as the <br>
character &acirc;?&acirc;; this is the default when output
is to a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Reverse the order of the
sort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Display the number of blocks
used in the file system by each <br>
file. Block sizes and directory totals are handled as
described <br>
in The Long Format subsection below, except (if the long
format <br>
is not also requested) the directory totals are not output
when <br>
the output is in a single column, even if multi-column
output is <br>
requested. (-l) format, display complete time information
for <br>
the file, including month, day, hour, minute, second, and
year. <br>
The -D option gives even more control over the output
format. <br>
This option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008
(&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Sort by descending time
modified (most recently modified first). <br>
If two files have the same modification timestamp, sort
their <br>
names in ascending lexicographical order. The -r option
reverses <br>
both of these sort orders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that these sort orders are
contradictory: the time sequence <br>
is in descending order, the lexicographical sort is in
ascending <br>
order. This behavior is mandated by IEEE Std 1003.2
(&acirc;POSIX.2&acirc;). <br>
This feature can cause problems listing files stored with
<br>
sequential names on FAT file systems, such as from digital
<br>
cameras, where it is possible to have more than one image
with <br>
the same timestamp. In such a case, the photos cannot be
listed <br>
in the sequence in which they were taken. To ensure the same
<br>
sort order for time and for lexicographical sorting, set the
<br>
environment variable LS_SAMESORT or use the -y option. This
<br>
causes ls to reverse the lexicographical sort order when
sorting <br>
files with the same modification timestamp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Use time of last access,
instead of time of last modification of <br>
the file for sorting (-t) or long printing (-l).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Force unedited printing of
non-graphic characters; this is the <br>
default when output is not to a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Force raw printing of
non-printable characters. This is the <br>
default when output is not to a terminal. This option is not
<br>
defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x The same as -C, except that
the multi-column output is produced <br>
with entries sorted across, rather than down, the
columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y When the -t option is set,
sort the alphabetical output in the <br>
same order as the time output. This has the same effect as
<br>
setting LS_SAMESORT. See the description of the -t option
for <br>
more details. This option is not defined in IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 <br>
(&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-% Distinguish dataless files
and directories with a &rsquo;%&rsquo; character <br>
in long</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 (The numeric digit
&acirc;one&acirc;.) Force output to be one entry per line.
<br>
This is the default when output is not to a terminal. (-l)
<br>
output, and don&rsquo;t materialize dataless directories
when listing <br>
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-, (Comma) When the -l option is
set, print file sizes grouped and <br>
separated by thousands using the non-monetary separator
returned <br>
by localeconv(3), typically a comma or period. If no locale
is <br>
set, or the locale does not have a non-monetary separator,
this <br>
option has no effect. This option is not defined in IEEE Std
<br>
1003.1-2001 (&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -1, -C, -x, and -l options
all override each other; the last one <br>
specified determines the format used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -c, -u, and -U options all
override each other; the last one <br>
specified determines the file time used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -S and -t options override
each other; the last one specified <br>
determines the sort order used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -B, -b, -w, and -q options
all override each other; the last one <br>
specified determines the format used for non-printable
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -H, -L and -P options all
override each other (either partially or <br>
fully); they are applied in the order specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, ls lists one entry
per line to standard output; the <br>
exceptions are to terminals or when the -C or -x options are
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File information is displayed
with one or more &acirc;&uml;blank&acirc;&copy;s separating
the <br>
information associated with the -i, -s, and -l options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Long Format <br>
If the -l option is given, the following information is
displayed for <br>
each file: file mode, number of links, owner name, group
name, number of <br>
bytes in the file, abbreviated month, day-of-month file was
last <br>
modified, hour file last modified, minute file last
modified, and the <br>
pathname. If the file or directory has extended attributes,
the <br>
permissions field printed by the -l option is followed by a
&rsquo;@&rsquo; <br>
character. Otherwise, if the file or directory has extended
security <br>
information (such as an access control list), the
permissions field <br>
printed by the -l option is followed by a &rsquo;+&rsquo;
character. If the -% <br>
option is given, a &rsquo;%&rsquo; character follows the
permissions field for <br>
dataless files and directories, possibly replacing the
&rsquo;@&rsquo; or &rsquo;+&rsquo; <br>
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the modification time of the
file is more than 6 months in the past or <br>
future, and the -D or -T are not specified, then the year of
the last <br>
modification is displayed in place of the hour and minute
fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the owner or group names are
not a known user or group name, or the -n <br>
option is given, the numeric ID&rsquo;s are displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file is a character
special or block special file, the device <br>
number for the file is displayed in the size field. If the
file is a <br>
symbolic link the pathname of the linked-to file is preceded
by &acirc;-&gt;&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The listing of a
directory&rsquo;s contents is preceded by a labeled total
<br>
number of blocks used in the file system by the files which
are listed as <br>
the directory&rsquo;s contents (which may or may not include
. and .. and other <br>
files which start with a dot, depending on other
options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default block size is 512
bytes. The block size may be set with <br>
option -k or environment variable BLOCKSIZE. Numbers of
blocks in the <br>
output will have been rounded up so the numbers of bytes is
at least as <br>
many as used by the corresponding file system blocks (which
might have a <br>
different size).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file mode printed under the
-l option consists of the entry type and <br>
the permissions. The entry type character describes the type
of file, as <br>
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Regular file. <br>
b Block special file. <br>
c Character special file. <br>
d Directory. <br>
l Symbolic link. <br>
p FIFO. <br>
s Socket. <br>
w Whiteout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next three fields are three
characters each: owner permissions, group <br>
permissions, and other permissions. Each field has three
character <br>
positions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If r, the file is readable;
if -, it is not readable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If w, the file is writable;
if -, it is not writable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The first of the following
that applies:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S If in the owner permissions,
the file is not <br>
executable and set-user-ID mode is set. If in the <br>
group permissions, the file is not executable and <br>
set-group-ID mode is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s If in the owner permissions,
the file is <br>
executable and set-user-ID mode is set. If in the <br>
group permissions, the file is executable and <br>
setgroup-ID mode is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x The file is executable or the
directory is <br>
searchable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The file is neither readable,
writable, <br>
executable, nor set-user-ID nor set-group-ID mode, <br>
nor sticky. (See below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These next two apply only to the
third character in the last <br>
group (other permissions).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T The sticky bit is set (mode
1000), but not execute <br>
or search permission. (See chmod(1) or <br>
sticky(7).)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t The sticky bit is set (mode
1000), and is <br>
searchable or executable. (See chmod(1) or <br>
sticky(7).)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next field contains a plus
(&acirc;+&acirc;) character if the file has an ACL, or <br>
a space (&acirc; &acirc;) if it does not. The ls utility
does not show the actual <br>
ACL unless the -e option is used in conjunction with the -l
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The following environment variables affect the execution of
ls:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BLOCKSIZE If this is set, its
value, rounded up to 512 or down <br>
to a multiple of 512, will be used as the block size <br>
in bytes by the -l and -s options. See The Long <br>
Format subsection for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLICOLOR Use ANSI color
sequences to distinguish file types. <br>
See LSCOLORS below. In addition to the file types <br>
mentioned in the -F option some extra attributes <br>
(setuid bit set, etc.) are also displayed. The <br>
colorization is dependent on a terminal type with the <br>
proper termcap(5) capabilities. The default
&acirc;cons25&acirc; <br>
console has the proper capabilities, but to display <br>
the colors in an xterm(1), for example, the TERM <br>
variable must be set to &acirc;xterm-color&acirc;. Other
<br>
terminal types may require similar adjustments. <br>
Colorization is silently disabled if the output is <br>
not directed to a terminal unless the CLICOLOR_FORCE <br>
variable is defined or --color is set to
&acirc;always&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLICOLOR_FORCE Color sequences
are normally disabled if the output <br>
is not directed to a terminal. This can be <br>
overridden by setting this variable. The TERM <br>
variable still needs to reference a color capable <br>
terminal however otherwise it is not possible to <br>
determine which color sequences to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLORTERM See description for
CLICOLOR above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLUMNS If this variable
contains a string representing a <br>
decimal integer, it is used as the column position <br>
width for displaying multiple-text-column output. <br>
The ls utility calculates how many pathname text <br>
columns to display based on the width provided. (See <br>
-C and -x.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG The locale to use when
determining the order of day <br>
and month in the long -l format output. See <br>
environ(7) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LSCOLORS The value of this
variable describes what color to <br>
use for which attribute when colors are enabled with <br>
CLICOLOR or COLORTERM. This string is a <br>
concatenation of pairs of the format fb, where f is <br>
the foreground color and b is the background color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The color designators are as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a black <br>
b red <br>
c green <br>
d brown <br>
e blue <br>
f magenta <br>
g cyan <br>
h light grey <br>
A bold black, usually shows up as dark grey <br>
B bold red <br>
C bold green <br>
D bold brown, usually shows up as yellow <br>
E bold blue <br>
F bold magenta <br>
G bold cyan <br>
H bold light grey; looks like bright white <br>
x default foreground or background</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the above are standard
ANSI colors. The <br>
actual display may differ depending on the color <br>
capabilities of the terminal in use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The order of the attributes are
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. directory <br>
2. symbolic link <br>
3. socket <br>
4. pipe <br>
5. executable <br>
6. block special <br>
7. character special <br>
8. executable with setuid bit set <br>
9. executable with setgid bit set <br>
10. directory writable to others, with sticky <br>
bit <br>
11. directory writable to others, without <br>
sticky bit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
&quot;exfxcxdxbxegedabagacad&quot;, i.e., blue <br>
foreground and default background for regular <br>
directories, black foreground and red background for <br>
setuid executables, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LS_COLWIDTHS If this variable is
set, it is considered to be a <br>
colon-delimited list of minimum column widths. <br>
Unreasonable and insufficient widths are ignored <br>
(thus zero signifies a dynamically sized column). <br>
Not all columns have changeable widths. The fields <br>
are, in order: inode, block count, number of links, <br>
user name, group name, flags, file size, file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LS_SAMESORT If this variable is
set, the -t option sorts the <br>
names of files with the same modification timestamp <br>
in the same sense as the time sort. See the <br>
description of the -t option for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERM The CLICOLOR and COLORTERM
functionality depends on a <br>
terminal type with color capabilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TZ The timezone to use when
displaying dates. See <br>
environ(7) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The ls utility exits&Acirc;&nbsp;0 on success,
and&Acirc;&nbsp;&gt;0 if an error occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
List the contents of the current working directory in long
format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ ls -l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to listing the
contents of the current working directory in <br>
long format, show inode numbers, file flags (see
chflags(1)), and suffix <br>
each filename with a symbol representing its file type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ ls -lioF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List the files in /var/log,
sorting the output such that the most <br>
recently modified entries are printed first:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ ls -lt /var/log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY <br>
The group field is now automatically included in the long
listing for <br>
files in order to be compatible with the IEEE Std 1003.2
(&acirc;POSIX.2&acirc;) <br>
specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LEGACY DESCRIPTION <br>
In legacy mode, the -f option does not turn on the -a option
and the -g, <br>
-n, and -o options do not turn on the -l option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, the -o option causes the
file flags to be included in a long (-l) <br>
output; there is no -O option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When -H is specified (and not
overridden by -L or -P) and a file argument <br>
is a symlink that resolves to a non-directory file, the
output will <br>
reflect the nature of the link, rather than that of the
file. In legacy <br>
operation, the output will describe the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information about
legacy mode, see compat(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARDS <br>
With the exception of options -g, -n and -o, the ls utility
conforms to <br>
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;) and IEEE Std
1003.1-2008 (&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;). <br>
The options -B, -D, -G, -I, -T, -U, -W, -Z, -b, -h, -w, -y
and -, are <br>
non-standard extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ACL support is compatible
with IEEE Std&Acirc;&nbsp;1003.2c (&acirc;POSIX.2c&acirc;)
Draft&Acirc;&nbsp;17 <br>
(withdrawn).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
An ls command appeared in Version&Acirc;&nbsp;1 AT&amp;T
UNIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
To maintain backward compatibility, the relationships
between the many <br>
options are quite complex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exception mentioned in the
-s option description might be a feature <br>
that was based on the fact that single-column output usually
goes to <br>
something other than a terminal. It is debatable whether
this is a <br>
design bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IEEE Std 1003.2
(&acirc;POSIX.2&acirc;) mandates opposite sort orders for
files with <br>
the same timestamp when sorting with the -t option.</p>
