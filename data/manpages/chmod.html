<p>CHMOD(1) General Commands Manual CHMOD(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
chmod &acirc; change file modes or Access Control Lists</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] mode file ... <br>
chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-a | +a | =a] ACE file ...
<br>
chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-E] file ... <br>
chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-C] file ... <br>
chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-N] file ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The chmod utility modifies the file mode bits of the listed
files as <br>
specified by the mode operand. It may also be used to modify
the Access <br>
Control Lists (ACLs) associated with the listed files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The generic options are as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Do not display a diagnostic
message if chmod could not modify the <br>
mode for file, nor modify the exit status to reflect such
<br>
failures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H If the -R option is
specified, symbolic links on the command line <br>
are followed and hence unaffected by the command. (Symbolic
<br>
links encountered during tree traversal are not
followed.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h If the file is a symbolic
link, change the mode of the link <br>
itself rather than the file that the link points to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L If the -R option is
specified, all symbolic links are followed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P If the -R option is
specified, no symbolic links are followed. <br>
This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Change the modes of the file
hierarchies rooted in the files, <br>
instead of just the files themselves. Beware of
unintentionally <br>
matching the &acirc;..&acirc; hard link to the parent
directory when using <br>
wildcards like &acirc;.*&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Cause chmod to be verbose,
showing filenames as the mode is <br>
modified. If the -v flag is specified more than once, the
old <br>
and new modes of the file will also be printed, in both
octal and <br>
symbolic notation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -H, -L and -P options are
ignored unless the -R option is specified. <br>
In addition, these options override each other and the
command&rsquo;s actions <br>
are determined by the last one specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If chmod receives a SIGINFO
signal (see the status argument for stty(1)), <br>
then the current filename as well as the old and new modes
are displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the owner of a file or the
super-user is permitted to change the <br>
mode of a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The chmod utility exits&Acirc;&nbsp;0 on success,
and&Acirc;&nbsp;&gt;0 if an error occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODES <br>
Modes may be absolute or symbolic. An absolute mode is an
octal number <br>
constructed from the sum of one or more of the following
values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4000 (the setuid bit).
Executable files with this bit set will <br>
run with effective uid set to the uid of the file owner.
<br>
Directories with this bit set will force all files and sub-
<br>
directories created in them to be owned by the directory
<br>
owner and not by the uid of the creating process, if the
<br>
underlying file system supports this feature: see chmod(2)
<br>
and the suiddir option to mount(8). <br>
2000 (the setgid bit). Executable files with this bit set
will <br>
run with effective gid set to the gid of the file owner.
<br>
1000 (the sticky bit). See chmod(2) and sticky(7). <br>
0400 Allow read by owner. <br>
0200 Allow write by owner. <br>
0100 For files, allow execution by owner. For directories,
<br>
allow the owner to search in the directory. <br>
0040 Allow read by group members. <br>
0020 Allow write by group members. <br>
0010 For files, allow execution by group members. For <br>
directories, allow group members to search in the <br>
directory. <br>
0004 Allow read by others. <br>
0002 Allow write by others. <br>
0001 For files, allow execution by others. For directories
<br>
allow others to search in the directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the absolute mode
that permits read, write and execute by <br>
the owner, read and execute by group members, read and
execute by others, <br>
and no set-uid or set-gid behaviour is 755
(400+200+100+040+010+004+001).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The symbolic mode is described
by the following grammar:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode ::= clause [, clause ...]
<br>
clause ::= [who ...] [action ...] action <br>
action ::= op [perm ...] <br>
who ::= a | u | g | o <br>
op ::= + | - | = <br>
perm ::= r | s | t | w | x | X | u | g | o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The who symbols
&lsquo;&lsquo;u&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;g&rsquo;&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;&lsquo;o&rsquo;&rsquo; specify the user, group, and
<br>
other parts of the mode bits, respectively. The who symbol
&lsquo;&lsquo;a&rsquo;&rsquo; is <br>
equivalent to &lsquo;&lsquo;ugo&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The perm symbols represent the
portions of the mode bits as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r The read bits. <br>
s The set-user-ID-on-execution and set-group-ID-on-execution
<br>
bits. <br>
t The sticky bit. <br>
w The write bits. <br>
x The execute/search bits. <br>
X The execute/search bits if the file is a directory or any
<br>
of the execute/search bits are set in the original <br>
(unmodified) mode. Operations with the perm symbol
&lsquo;&lsquo;X&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
are only meaningful in conjunction with the op symbol <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;+&rsquo;&rsquo;, and are ignored in all other
cases. <br>
u The user permission bits in the original mode of the file.
<br>
g The group permission bits in the original mode of the
file. <br>
o The other permission bits in the original mode of the
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The op symbols represent the
operation performed, as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ If no value is supplied for
perm, the &lsquo;&lsquo;+&rsquo;&rsquo; operation has no
<br>
effect. If no value is supplied for who, each permission bit
<br>
specified in perm, for which the corresponding bit in the
file mode <br>
creation mask (see umask(2)) is clear, is set. Otherwise,
the mode <br>
bits represented by the specified who and perm values are
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- If no value is supplied for
perm, the &lsquo;&lsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo; operation has no
<br>
effect. If no value is supplied for who, each permission bit
<br>
specified in perm, for which the corresponding bit in the
file mode <br>
creation mask is set, is cleared. Otherwise, the mode bits
<br>
represented by the specified who and perm values are
cleared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= The mode bits specified by the
who value are cleared, or, if no who <br>
value is specified, the owner, group and other mode bits are
<br>
cleared. Then, if no value is supplied for who, each
permission <br>
bit specified in perm, for which the corresponding bit in
the file <br>
mode creation mask (see umask(2)) is clear, is set.
Otherwise, the <br>
mode bits represented by the specified who and perm values
are set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each clause specifies one or
more operations to be performed on the mode <br>
bits, and each operation is applied to the mode bits in the
order <br>
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operations upon the other
permissions only (specified by the symbol
&lsquo;&lsquo;o&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
by itself), in combination with the perm symbols
&lsquo;&lsquo;s&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;t&rsquo;&rsquo;, are <br>
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The
&lsquo;&lsquo;w&rsquo;&rsquo; permission on directories will
permit file creation, <br>
relocation, and copy into that directory. Files created
within the <br>
directory itself will inherit its group ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES OF VALID MODES <br>
644 make a file readable by anyone and writable by the owner
<br>
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">go-w deny write permission to
group and others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=rw,+X set the read and write
permissions to the usual defaults, <br>
but retain any execute permissions that are currently
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+X make a directory or file
searchable/executable by everyone <br>
if it is already searchable/executable by anyone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">755 <br>
u=rwx,go=rx <br>
u=rwx,go=u-w make a file readable/executable by everyone and
writable by <br>
the owner only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">go= clear all mode bits for
group and others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g=u-w set the group bits equal
to the user bits, but clear the <br>
group write bit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACL MANIPULATION OPTIONS <br>
ACLs are manipulated using extensions to the symbolic mode
grammar. Each <br>
file has one ACL, containing an ordered list of entries.
Each entry <br>
refers to a user or group, and grants or denies a set of
permissions. In <br>
cases where a user and a group exist with the same name, the
user/group <br>
name can be prefixed with &quot;user:&quot; or
&quot;group:&quot; in order to specify the <br>
type of name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the user or group name
contains spaces you can use &rsquo;:&rsquo; as the <br>
delimiter between name and permission.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following permissions are
applicable to all filesystem objects: <br>
delete Delete the item. Deletion may be granted by either
this <br>
permission on an object or the delete_child right on the
<br>
containing directory. <br>
readattr <br>
Read an object&rsquo;s basic attributes. This is implicitly
<br>
granted if the object can be looked up and not explicitly
<br>
denied. <br>
writeattr <br>
Write an object&rsquo;s basic attributes. <br>
readextattr <br>
Read extended attributes. <br>
writeextattr <br>
Write extended attributes. <br>
readsecurity <br>
Read an object&rsquo;s extended security information (ACL).
<br>
writesecurity <br>
Write an object&rsquo;s security information (ownership,
mode, <br>
ACL). <br>
chown Change an object&rsquo;s ownership.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following permissions are
applicable to directories: <br>
list List entries. <br>
search Look up files by name. <br>
add_file <br>
Add a file. <br>
add_subdirectory <br>
Add a subdirectory. <br>
delete_child <br>
Delete a contained object. See the file delete permission
<br>
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following permissions are
applicable to non-directory filesystem <br>
objects: <br>
read Open for reading. <br>
write Open for writing. <br>
append Open for writing, but in a fashion that only allows
writes <br>
into areas of the file not previously written. <br>
execute <br>
Execute the file as a script or program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACL inheritance is controlled
with the following permissions words, which <br>
may only be applied to directories: <br>
file_inherit <br>
Inherit to files. <br>
directory_inherit <br>
Inherit to directories. <br>
limit_inherit <br>
This flag is only relevant to entries inherited by <br>
subdirectories; it causes the directory_inherit flag to be
<br>
cleared in the entry that is inherited, preventing further
<br>
nested subdirectories from also inheriting the entry. <br>
only_inherit <br>
The entry is inherited by created items but not considered
<br>
when processing the ACL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ACL manipulation options are
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+a The +a mode parses a new ACL
entry from the next argument on the <br>
commandline and inserts it into the canonical location in
the <br>
ACL. If the supplied entry refers to an identity already
listed, <br>
the two entries are combined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples <br>
# ls -le <br>

2: User 1 allow read <br>
3: admin allow write,delete</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The +a mode strives to maintain
correct canonical form for the <br>
ACL. <br>
local deny <br>
local allow <br>
inherited deny <br>
inherited allow</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, chmod adds entries
to the top of the local deny and <br>
local allow lists. Inherited entries are added by using the
+ai <br>
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples <br>
# ls -le <br>
-rw-r--r--+ 1 juser wheel 0 Apr 28 14:06 file1 <br>

5: admin inherited allow delete <br>
6: backup inherited deny read <br>
7: admin inherited allow write-security</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+a# When a specific ordering is
required, the exact location at which <br>
an entry will be inserted is specified with the +a#
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples <br>
# ls -le <br>
-rw-r--r--+ 1 juser wheel 0 Apr 28 14:06 file1 <br>

2: others deny read <br>
3: admin allow write</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The +ai# mode may be used to
insert inherited entries at a <br>
specific location. Note that these modes allow non-canonical
ACL <br>
ordering to be constructed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a The -a mode is used to delete
ACL entries. All entries exactly <br>
matching the supplied entry will be deleted. If the entry
lists a <br>
subset of rights granted by an entry, only the rights listed
are <br>
removed. Entries may also be deleted by index using the -a#
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples <br>
# ls -le <br>
-rw-r--r--+ 1 juser wheel 0 Apr 28 14:06 file1 <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inheritance is not considered
when processing the -a mode; rights <br>
and entries will be removed regardless of their inherited
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the user or group name
contains spaces you can use &rsquo;:&rsquo; as the <br>
delimiter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example <br>
# chmod +a &quot;User 1:allow:read&quot; file1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=a# Individual entries are

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This mode may not be used to add
new entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Reads the ACL information
from stdin, as a sequential list of <br>
ACEs, separated by newlines. If the information parses <br>
correctly, the existing information is replaced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Returns false if any of the
named files have ACLs in non- <br>
canonical order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Removes the
&rsquo;inherited&rsquo; bit from all entries in the named
file(s) <br>
ACLs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Removes all inherited entries
from the named file(s) ACL(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Removes the ACL from the
named file(s).</p>
