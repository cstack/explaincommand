<p>FIND(1) General Commands Manual FIND(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
find &acirc; walk a file hierarchy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
find [-H | -L | -P] [-EXdsx] [-f path] path ... [expression]
<br>
find [-H | -L | -P] [-EXdsx] -f path [path ...]
[expression]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The find utility recursively descends the directory tree for
each path <br>
listed, evaluating an expression (composed of the
&acirc;primaries&acirc; and <br>
&acirc;operands&acirc; listed below) in terms of each file
in the tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Interpret regular expressions
followed by -regex and -iregex <br>
primaries as extended (modern) regular expressions rather
than <br>
basic regular expressions (BRE&rsquo;s). The re_format(7)
manual page <br>
fully describes both formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Cause the file information
and file type (see stat(2)) returned <br>
for each symbolic link specified on the command line to be
those <br>
of the file referenced by the link, not the link itself. If
the <br>
referenced file does not exist, the file information and
type <br>
will be for the link itself. File information of all
symbolic <br>
links not on the command line is that of the link
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Cause the file information
and file type (see stat(2)) returned <br>
for each symbolic link to be those of the file referenced by
the <br>
link, not the link itself. If the referenced file does not
<br>
exist, the file information and type will be for the link
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is equivalent to the
deprecated -follow primary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Cause the file information
and file type (see stat(2)) returned <br>
for each symbolic link to be those of the link itself. This
is <br>
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X Permit find to be safely used
in conjunction with xargs(1). If a <br>
file name contains any of the delimiting characters used by
<br>
xargs(1), a diagnostic message is displayed on standard
error, <br>
and the file is skipped. The delimiting characters include
<br>
single (&acirc; &rsquo; &acirc;) and double (&acirc; &quot;
&acirc;) quotes, backslash (&acirc;&acirc;), space, <br>
tab and newline characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, you may wish to
consider the -print0 primary in <br>
conjunction with &acirc;xargs -0&acirc; as an effective
alternative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Cause find to perform a
depth-first traversal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is a BSD-specific
equivalent of the -depth primary <br>
specified by IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;).
Refer to its <br>
description under PRIMARIES for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Cause find to traverse the
file hierarchies in lexicographical <br>
order, i.e., alphabetical order within each directory. Note:
<br>
&acirc;find -s&acirc; and &acirc;find | sort&acirc; may give
different results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Prevent find from descending
into directories that have a device <br>
number different than that of the file from which the
descent <br>
began.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is equivalent to the
deprecated -xdev primary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRIMARIES <br>
All primaries which take a numeric argument allow the number
to be <br>
preceded by a plus sign (&acirc;+&acirc;) or a minus sign
(&acirc;-&acirc;). A preceding plus <br>
sign means &acirc;more than n&acirc;, a preceding minus sign
means &acirc;less than n&acirc; and <br>
neither means &acirc;exactly n&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Bmin n <br>
True if the difference between the time of a file&rsquo;s
inode <br>
creation and the time find was started, rounded up to the
next <br>
full minute, is n minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Bnewer file <br>
Same as -newerBm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Btime n[smhdw] <br>
If no units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if
the <br>
difference between the time of a file&rsquo;s inode creation
and the <br>
time find was started, rounded up to the next full 24-hour
<br>
period, is n 24-hour periods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If units are specified, this
primary evaluates to true if the <br>
difference between the time of a file&rsquo;s inode creation
and the <br>
time find was started is exactly n units. Please refer to
the <br>
-atime primary description for information on supported time
<br>
units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-acl May be used in conjunction
with other primaries to locate files <br>
with extended ACLs. See acl(3) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-amin [-|+]n <br>
True if the difference between the file last access time and
the <br>
time find was started, rounded up to the next full minute,
is <br>
more than n (+n), less than n (-n), or exactly n minutes
ago.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-anewer file <br>
Same as -neweram.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-atime n[smhdw] <br>
If no units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if
the <br>
difference between the file last access time and the time
find <br>
was started, rounded up to the next full 24-hour period, is
n <br>
24-hour periods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If units are specified, this
primary evaluates to true if the <br>
difference between the file last access time and the time
find <br>
was started is exactly n units. Possible time units are as
<br>
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s second <br>
m minute (60 seconds) <br>
h hour (60 minutes) <br>
d day (24 hours) <br>
w week (7 days)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any number of units may be
combined in one -atime argument, for <br>
example, &acirc;-atime -1h30m&acirc;. Units are probably
only useful when <br>
used in conjunction with the + or - modifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cmin [-|+]n <br>
True if the difference between the time of last change of
file <br>
status information and the time find was started, rounded up
to <br>
the next full minute, is more than n (+n), less than n (-n),
or <br>
exactly n minutes ago.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cnewer file <br>
Same as -newercm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ctime n[smhdw] <br>
If no units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if
the <br>
difference between the time of last change of file status
<br>
information and the time find was started, rounded up to the
next <br>
full 24-hour period, is n 24-hour periods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If units are specified, this
primary evaluates to true if the <br>
difference between the time of last change of file status
<br>
information and the time find was started is exactly n
units. <br>
Please refer to the -atime primary description for
information on <br>
supported time units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Non-portable, BSD-specific
version of depth. GNU find implements <br>
this as a primary in mistaken emulation of FreeBSD find.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-delete <br>
Delete found files and/or directories. Always returns true.
<br>
This executes from the current working directory as find
recurses <br>
down the tree. It will not attempt to delete a filename with
a <br>
&acirc;/&acirc; character in its pathname relative to
&acirc;.&acirc; for security <br>
reasons. Depth-first traversal processing is implied by this
<br>
option. The -delete primary will fail to delete a directory
if <br>
it is not empty. Following symlinks is incompatible with
this <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-depth Always true; same as the
non-portable -d option. Cause find to <br>
perform a depth-first traversal, i.e., directories are
visited in <br>
post-order and all entries in a directory will be acted on
before <br>
the directory itself. By default, find visits directories in
<br>
pre-order, i.e., before their contents. Note, the default is
not <br>
a breadth-first traversal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -depth primary can be useful
when find is used with cpio(1) <br>
to process files that are contained in directories with
unusual <br>
permissions. It ensures that you have write permission while
you <br>
are placing files in a directory, then sets the
directory&rsquo;s <br>
permissions as the last thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-depth n <br>
True if the depth of the file relative to the starting point
of <br>
the traversal is n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-empty True if the current file
or directory is empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-exec utility [argument ...] ;
<br>
True if the program named utility returns a zero value as
its <br>
exit status. Optional arguments may be passed to the
utility. <br>
The expression must be terminated by a semicolon
(&acirc;;&acirc;). If you <br>
invoke find from a shell you may need to quote the semicolon
if <br>
the shell would otherwise treat it as a control operator. If
the <br>
string &acirc;{}&acirc; appears anywhere in the utility name
or the arguments <br>
it is replaced by the pathname of the current file. Utility
will <br>
be executed from the directory from which find was executed.
<br>
Utility and arguments are not subject to the further
expansion of <br>
shell patterns and constructs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-exec utility [argument ...] {}
+ <br>
Same as -exec, except that &acirc;{}&acirc; is replaced with
as many <br>
pathnames as possible for each invocation of utility. This
<br>
behaviour is similar to that of xargs(1). The primary always
<br>
returns true; if at least one invocation of utility returns
a <br>
non-zero exit status, find will return a non-zero exit
status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-execdir utility [argument ...]
; <br>
The -execdir primary is identical to the -exec primary with
the <br>
exception that utility will be executed from the directory
that <br>
holds the current file. The filename substituted for the
string <br>
&acirc;{}&acirc; is not qualified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-execdir utility [argument ...]
{} + <br>
Same as -execdir, except that &acirc;{}&acirc; is replaced
with as many <br>
pathnames as possible for each invocation of utility. This
<br>
behaviour is similar to that of xargs(1). The primary always
<br>
returns true; if at least one invocation of utility returns
a <br>
non-zero exit status, find will return a non-zero exit
status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flags [-|+]flags,notflags <br>
The flags are specified using symbolic names (see
chflags(1)). <br>
Those with the &quot;no&quot; prefix (except
&quot;nodump&quot;) are said to be <br>
notflags. Flags in flags are checked to be set, and flags in
<br>
notflags are checked to be not set. Note that this is
different <br>
from -perm, which only allows the user to specify mode bits
that <br>
are set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If flags are preceded by a dash
(&acirc;-&acirc;), this primary evaluates to <br>
true if at least all of the bits in flags and none of the
bits in <br>
notflags are set in the file&rsquo;s flags bits. If flags
are preceded <br>
by a plus (&acirc;+&acirc;), this primary evaluates to true
if any of the <br>
bits in flags is set in the file&rsquo;s flags bits, or any
of the bits <br>
in notflags is not set in the file&rsquo;s flags bits.
Otherwise, this <br>
primary evaluates to true if the bits in flags exactly match
the <br>
file&rsquo;s flags bits, and none of the flags bits match
those of <br>
notflags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstype type <br>
True if the file is contained in a file system of type type.
The <br>
lsvfs(1) command can be used to find out the types of file
<br>
systems that are available on the system. In addition, there
are <br>
two pseudo-types, &acirc;local&acirc; and
&acirc;rdonly&acirc;. The former matches any <br>
file system physically mounted on the system where the find
is <br>
being executed and the latter matches any file system which
is <br>
mounted read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gid gname <br>
The same thing as -group gname for compatibility with GNU
find. <br>
GNU find imposes a restriction that gname is numeric, while
find <br>
does not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-group gname <br>
True if the file belongs to the group gname. If gname is
numeric <br>
and there is no such group name, then gname is treated as a
group <br>
ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ignore_readdir_race <br>
Ignore errors because a file or a directory is deleted after
<br>
reading the name from a directory. This option does not
affect <br>
errors occurring on starting points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ilname pattern <br>
Like -lname, but the match is case insensitive. This is a
GNU <br>
find extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iname pattern <br>
Like -name, but the match is case insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-inum n <br>
True if the file has inode number n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ipath pattern <br>
Like -path, but the match is case insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iregex pattern <br>
Like -regex, but the match is case insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iwholename pattern <br>
The same thing as -ipath, for GNU find compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-links n <br>
True if the file has n links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lname pattern <br>
Like -name, but the contents of the symbolic link are
matched <br>
instead of the file name. Note that this only matches broken
<br>
symbolic links if symbolic links are being followed. This is
a <br>
GNU find extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ls This primary always
evaluates to true. The following information <br>
for the current file is written to standard output: its
inode <br>
number, size in 512-byte blocks, file permissions, number of
hard <br>
links, owner, group, size in bytes, last modification time,
and <br>
pathname. If the file is a block or character special file,
the <br>
device number will be displayed instead of the size in
bytes. If <br>
the file is a symbolic link, the pathname of the linked-to
file <br>
will be displayed preceded by &acirc;-&gt;&acirc;. The
format is identical to <br>
that produced by &acirc;ls -dgils&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maxdepth n <br>
Always true; descend at most n directory levels below the
command <br>
line arguments. If any -maxdepth primary is specified, it
<br>
applies to the entire expression even if it would not
normally be <br>
evaluated. &acirc;-maxdepth 0&acirc; limits the whole search
to the command <br>
line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mindepth n <br>
Always true; do not apply any tests or actions at levels
less <br>
than n. If any -mindepth primary is specified, it applies to
the <br>
entire expression even if it would not normally be
evaluated. <br>
&acirc;-mindepth 1&acirc; processes all but the command line
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmin [-|+]n <br>
True if the difference between the file last modification
time <br>
and the time find was started, rounded up to the next full
<br>
minute, is more than n (+n), less than n (-n), or exactly n
<br>
minutes ago.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mnewer file <br>
Same as -newer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mount The same thing as -xdev,
for GNU find compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtime n[smhdw] <br>
If no units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if
the <br>
difference between the file last modification time and the
time <br>
find was started, rounded up to the next full 24-hour
period, is <br>
n 24-hour periods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If units are specified, this
primary evaluates to true if the <br>
difference between the file last modification time and the
time <br>
find was started is exactly n units. Please refer to the
-atime <br>
primary description for information on supported time
units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-name pattern <br>
True if the last component of the pathname being examined
matches <br>
pattern. Special shell pattern matching characters
(&acirc;[&acirc;, &acirc;]&acirc;, <br>
&acirc;*&acirc;, and &acirc;?&acirc;) may be used as part of
pattern. These characters <br>
may be matched explicitly by escaping them with a backslash
<br>
(&acirc;&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-newer file <br>
True if the current file has a more recent last modification
time <br>
than file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-newerXY file <br>
True if the current file has a more recent last access time
<br>
(X=a), inode creation time (X=B), change time (X=c), or <br>
modification time (X=m) than the last access time (Y=a),
inode <br>
creation time (Y=B), change time (Y=c), or modification time
<br>
(Y=m) of file. In addition, if Y=t, then file is instead
<br>
interpreted as a direct date specification of the form
understood <br>
by cvs(1). Note that -newermm is equivalent to -newer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nogroup <br>
True if the file belongs to an unknown group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noignore_readdir_race <br>
Turn off the effect of -ignore_readdir_race. This is default
<br>
behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noleaf <br>
This option is for GNU find compatibility. In GNU find it
<br>
disables an optimization not relevant to find, so it is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nouser <br>
True if the file belongs to an unknown user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ok utility [argument ...] ;
<br>
The -ok primary is identical to the -exec primary with the
<br>
exception that find requests user affirmation for the
execution <br>
of the utility by printing a message to the terminal and
reading <br>
a response. If the response is not affirmative
(&acirc;y&acirc; in the <br>
&acirc;POSIX&acirc; locale), the command is not executed and
the value of the <br>
-ok expression is false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-okdir utility [argument ...] ;
<br>
The -okdir primary is identical to the -execdir primary with
the <br>
same exception as described for the -ok primary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-path pattern <br>
True if the pathname being examined matches pattern. Special
<br>
shell pattern matching characters (&acirc;[&acirc;,
&acirc;]&acirc;, &acirc;*&acirc;, and &acirc;?&acirc;) may
be <br>
used as part of pattern. These characters may be matched
<br>
explicitly by escaping them with a backslash
(&acirc;&acirc;). Slashes <br>
(&acirc;/&acirc;) are treated as normal characters and do
not have to be <br>
matched explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-perm [-|+]mode <br>
The mode may be either symbolic (see chmod(1)) or an octal
<br>
number. If the mode is symbolic, a starting value of zero is
<br>
assumed and the mode sets or clears permissions without
regard to <br>
the process&rsquo; file mode creation mask. If the mode is
octal, only <br>
bits 07777 (S_ISUID | S_ISGID | S_ISTXT | S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG
| <br>
S_IRWXO) of the file&rsquo;s mode bits participate in the
comparison. <br>
If the mode is preceded by a dash (&acirc;-&acirc;), this
primary evaluates <br>
to true if at least all of the bits in the mode are set in
the <br>
file&rsquo;s mode bits. If the mode is preceded by a plus
(&acirc;+&acirc;), this <br>
primary evaluates to true if any of the bits in the mode are
set <br>
in the file&rsquo;s mode bits. Otherwise, this primary
evaluates to <br>
true if the bits in the mode exactly match the file&rsquo;s
mode bits. <br>
Note, the first character of a symbolic mode may not be a
dash <br>
(&acirc;-&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print This primary always
evaluates to true. It prints the pathname of <br>
the current file to standard output. If none of -exec, -ls,
<br>
-print, -print0, or -ok is specified, the given expression
shall <br>
be effectively replaced by ( given expression ) -print.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print0 <br>
This primary always evaluates to true. It prints the
pathname of <br>
the current file to standard output, followed by an ASCII
NUL <br>
character (character code 0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-prune This primary always
evaluates to true. It causes find to not <br>
descend into the current file. Note, the -prune primary has
no <br>
effect if the -d option was specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quit Causes find to terminate
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-regex pattern <br>
True if the whole path of the file matches pattern using
regular <br>
expression. To match a file named &acirc;./foo/xyzzy&acirc;,
you can use the <br>
regular expression &acirc;.*/[xyz]*&acirc; or
&acirc;.*/foo/.*&acirc;, but not &acirc;xyzzy&acirc; or <br>
&acirc;/foo/&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-samefile name <br>
True if the file is a hard link to name. If the command
option <br>
-L is specified, it is also true if the file is a symbolic
link <br>
and points to name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-size n[ckMGTP] <br>
True if the file&rsquo;s size, rounded up, in 512-byte
blocks is n. If <br>
n is followed by a c, then the primary is true if the
file&rsquo;s size <br>
is n bytes (characters). Similarly if n is followed by a
scale <br>
indicator then the file&rsquo;s size is compared to n scaled
as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">k kilobytes (1024 bytes) <br>
M megabytes (1024 kilobytes) <br>
G gigabytes (1024 megabytes) <br>
T terabytes (1024 gigabytes) <br>
P petabytes (1024 terabytes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sparse <br>
True if the current file is sparse, i.e. has fewer blocks
<br>
allocated than expected based on its size in bytes. This
might <br>
also match files that have been compressed by the
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-type t <br>
True if the file is of the specified type. Possible file
types <br>
are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b block special <br>
c character special <br>
d directory <br>
f regular file <br>
l symbolic link <br>
p FIFO <br>
s socket</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-uid uname <br>
The same thing as -user uname for compatibility with GNU
find. <br>
GNU find imposes a restriction that uname is numeric, while
find <br>
does not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-user uname <br>
True if the file belongs to the user uname. If uname is
numeric <br>
and there is no such user name, then uname is treated as a
user <br>
ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wholename pattern <br>
The same thing as -path, for GNU find compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xattr True if the file has any
extended attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xattrname name <br>
True if the file has an extended attribute with the
specified <br>
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATORS <br>
The primaries may be combined using the following operators.
The <br>
operators are listed in order of decreasing precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">( expression ) <br>
This evaluates to true if the parenthesized expression
evaluates <br>
to true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! expression <br>
-not expression <br>
This is the unary NOT operator. It evaluates to true if the
<br>
expression is false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-false Always false. <br>
-true Always true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expression -and expression <br>
expression expression <br>
The -and operator is the logical AND operator. As it is
implied <br>
by the juxtaposition of two expressions it does not have to
be <br>
specified. The expression evaluates to true if both
expressions <br>
are true. The second expression is not evaluated if the
first <br>
expression is false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expression -or expression <br>
The -or operator is the logical OR operator. The expression
<br>
evaluates to true if either the first or the second
expression is <br>
true. The second expression is not evaluated if the first
<br>
expression is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All operands and primaries must
be separate arguments to find. Primaries <br>
which themselves take arguments expect each argument to be a
separate <br>
argument to find.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The LANG, LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES and
LC_TIME <br>
environment variables affect the execution of the find
utility as <br>
described in environ(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following examples are shown as given to the shell:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find / -name &quot;*.c&quot;
-print <br>
Print out a list of all the files whose names do not end in
.c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find / -newer ttt -user wnj
-print <br>
Print out a list of all the files owned by user
&acirc;wnj&acirc; that are <br>
newer than the file ttt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find / -newer ttt -user wnj
-print <br>
Print out a list of all the files which are not both newer
than <br>
ttt and owned by &acirc;wnj&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find / -newer ttt -or -user wnj
-print <br>
Print out a list of all the files that are either owned by
&acirc;wnj&acirc; <br>
or that are newer than ttt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find / -newerct &rsquo;1 minute
ago&rsquo; -print <br>
Print out a list of all the files whose inode change time is
more <br>
recent than the current time minus one minute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find / -type f -exec echo {} ;
<br>
Use the echo(1) command to print out a list of all the
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find -L /usr/ports/packages
-type l -exec rm -- {} + <br>
Delete all broken symbolic links in /usr/ports/packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find /usr/src -name CVS -prune
-o -depth +6 -print <br>
Find files and directories that are at least seven levels
deep in <br>
the working directory /usr/src.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find /usr/src -name CVS -prune
-o -mindepth 7 -print <br>
Is not equivalent to the previous example, since -prune is
not <br>
evaluated below level seven.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY <br>
The -follow primary is deprecated; the -L option should be
used instead. <br>
See the STANDARDS section below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARDS <br>
The find utility syntax is a superset of the syntax
specified by the IEEE <br>
Std 1003.1-2001 (&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;) standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the single character options
except -H and -L as well as -amin, <br>
-anewer, -cmin, -cnewer, -delete, -empty, -fstype, -iname,
-inum, <br>
-iregex, -ls, -maxdepth, -mindepth, -mmin, -not, -path,
-print0, -regex, <br>
-sparse and all of the -B* birthtime related primaries are
extensions to <br>
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historically, the -d, -L and -x
options were implemented using the <br>
primaries -depth, -follow, and -xdev. These primaries always
evaluated <br>
to true. As they were really global variables that took
effect before <br>
the traversal began, some legal expressions could have
unexpected <br>
results. An example is the expression -print -o -depth. As
-print <br>
always evaluates to true, the standard order of evaluation
implies that <br>
-depth would never be evaluated. This is not the case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The operator -or was implemented
as -o, and the operator -and was <br>
implemented as -a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historic implementations of the
-exec and -ok primaries did not replace <br>
the string &acirc;{}&acirc; in the utility name or the
utility arguments if it had <br>
preceding or following non-whitespace characters. This
version replaces <br>
it no matter where in the utility name or arguments it
appears.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -E option was inspired by
the equivalent grep(1) and sed(1) options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
A simple find command appeared in Version&Acirc;&nbsp;1
AT&amp;T UNIX and was removed in <br>
Version&Acirc;&nbsp;3 AT&amp;T UNIX. It was rewritten for
Version&Acirc;&nbsp;5 AT&amp;T UNIX and later <br>
be enhanced for the Programmer&rsquo;s Workbench (PWB).
These changes were <br>
later incorporated in AT&amp;T UNIX v7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The special characters used by find are also special
characters to many <br>
shell programs. In particular, the characters
&acirc;*&acirc;, &acirc;[&acirc;, &acirc;]&acirc;,
&acirc;?&acirc;, &acirc;(&acirc;, <br>
&acirc;)&acirc;, &acirc;!&acirc;, &acirc;&acirc; and
&acirc;;&acirc; may have to be escaped from the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As there is no delimiter
separating options and file names or file names <br>
and the expression, it is difficult to specify files named
-xdev or !. <br>
These problems are handled by the -f option and the
getopt(3) &acirc;--&acirc; <br>
construct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -delete primary does not
interact well with other options that cause <br>
the file system tree traversal options to be changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -mindepth and -maxdepth
primaries are actually global options (as <br>
documented above). They should probably be replaced by
options which <br>
look like options.</p>
