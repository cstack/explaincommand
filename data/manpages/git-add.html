git-add - Add file contents to the index</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git add [--verbose | -v] [--dry-run | -n] [--force | -f]
[--interactive | -i] [--patch | -p] <br>
[--edit | -e] [--[no-]all | --[no-]ignore-removal |

[--pathspec-file-nul]] <br>
[--] [&lt;pathspec&gt;...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This command updates the index using the current content
found in the <br>
working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next
commit. It <br>
typically adds the current content of existing paths as a
whole, but <br>
with some options it can also be used to add content with
only part of <br>
the changes made to the working tree files applied, or
remove paths <br>
that do not exist in the working tree anymore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;index&quot; holds a
snapshot of the content of the working tree, and it <br>
is this snapshot that is taken as the contents of the next
commit. Thus <br>
after making any changes to the working tree, and before
running the <br>
commit command, you must use the add command to add any new
or modified <br>
files to the index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command can be performed
multiple times before a commit. It only <br>
adds the content of the specified file(s) at the time the
add command <br>
is run; if you want subsequent changes included in the next
commit, <br>
then you must run git add again to add the new content to
the index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The git status command can be
used to obtain a summary of which files <br>
have changes that are staged for the next commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The git add command will not add
ignored files by default. If any <br>
ignored files were explicitly specified on the command line,
git add <br>
will fail with a list of ignored files. Ignored files
reached by <br>
directory recursion or filename globbing performed by Git
(quote your <br>
globs before the shell) will be silently ignored. The git
add command <br>
can be used to add ignored files with the -f (force)
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please see git-commit(1) for
alternative ways to add content to a <br>
commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
&lt;pathspec&gt;... <br>
Files to add content from. Fileglobs (e.g. *.c) can be given
to <br>
add all matching files. Also a leading directory name (e.g.
dir to <br>
add dir/file1 and dir/file2) can be given to update the
index to <br>
match the current state of the directory as a whole (e.g.
<br>
specifying dir will record not just a file dir/file1
modified in <br>
the working tree, a file dir/file2 added to the working
tree, but <br>
also a file dir/file3 removed from the working tree). Note
that <br>
older versions of Git used to ignore removed files; use
--no-all <br>
option if you want to add modified or new files but ignore
removed <br>
ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more details about the
&lt;pathspec&gt; syntax, see the pathspec <br>
entry in gitglossary(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --dry-run <br>
Don&acirc;t actually add the file(s), just show if they
exist and/or will <br>
be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Be verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
Allow adding otherwise ignored files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sparse <br>
Allow updating index entries outside of the sparse-checkout
cone. <br>
Normally, git add refuses to update index entries whose
paths do <br>
not fit within the sparse-checkout cone, since those files
might be <br>
removed from the working tree without warning. See
git-sparse- <br>
checkout(1) for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --interactive <br>
Add modified contents in the working tree interactively to
the <br>
index. Optional path arguments may be supplied to limit
operation <br>
to a subset of the working tree. See &acirc;Interactive
mode&acirc; for <br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --patch <br>
Interactively choose hunks of patch between the index and
the work <br>
tree and add them to the index. This gives the user a chance
to <br>
review the difference before adding modified contents to the
index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This effectively runs add
--interactive, but bypasses the initial <br>
command menu and directly jumps to the patch subcommand. See
<br>
&acirc;Interactive mode&acirc; for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --edit <br>
Open the diff vs. the index in an editor and let the user
edit it. <br>
After the editor was closed, adjust the hunk headers and
apply the <br>
patch to the index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The intent of this option is to
pick and choose lines of the patch <br>
to apply, or even to modify the contents of lines to be
staged. <br>
This can be quicker and more flexible than using the
interactive <br>
hunk selector. However, it is easy to confuse oneself and
create a <br>
patch that does not apply to the index. See EDITING PATCHES
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --update <br>
Update the index just where it already has an entry matching
<br>
&lt;pathspec&gt;. This removes as well as modifies index
entries to match <br>
the working tree, but adds no new files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no &lt;pathspec&gt; is given
when -u option is used, all tracked files <br>
in the entire working tree are updated (old versions of Git
used to <br>
limit the update to the current directory and its
subdirectories).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --all, --no-ignore-removal
<br>
Update the index not only where the working tree has a file
<br>
matching &lt;pathspec&gt; but also where the index already
has an entry. <br>
This adds, modifies, and removes index entries to match the
working <br>
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no &lt;pathspec&gt; is given
when -A option is used, all files in the <br>
entire working tree are updated (old versions of Git used to
limit <br>
the update to the current directory and its
subdirectories).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-all, --ignore-removal <br>
Update the index by adding new files that are unknown to the
index <br>
and files modified in the working tree, but ignore files
that have <br>
been removed from the working tree. This option is a no-op
when no <br>
&lt;pathspec&gt; is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is primarily to help
users who are used to older <br>
versions of Git, whose &quot;git add
&lt;pathspec&gt;...&quot; was a synonym for <br>
&quot;git add --no-all &lt;pathspec&gt;...&quot;, i.e.
ignored removed files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --intent-to-add <br>
Record only the fact that the path will be added later. An
entry <br>
for the path is placed in the index with no content. This is
useful <br>
for, among other things, showing the unstaged content of
such files <br>
with git diff and committing them with git commit -a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--refresh <br>
Don&acirc;t add the file(s), but only refresh their stat()
information in <br>
the index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-errors <br>
If some files could not be added because of errors indexing
them, <br>
do not abort the operation, but continue adding the others.
The <br>
command shall still exit with non-zero status. The
configuration <br>
variable add.ignoreErrors can be set to true to make this
the <br>
default behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-missing <br>
This option can only be used together with --dry-run. By
using this <br>
option the user can check if any of the given files would be
<br>
ignored, no matter if they are already present in the work
tree or <br>
not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-warn-embedded-repo <br>
By default, git add will warn when adding an embedded
repository to <br>
the index without using git submodule add to create an entry
in <br>
.gitmodules. This option will suppress the warning (e.g., if
you <br>
are manually performing operations on submodules).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--renormalize <br>
Apply the &quot;clean&quot; process freshly to all tracked
files to forcibly <br>
add them again to the index. This is useful after changing
<br>
core.autocrlf configuration or the text attribute in order
to <br>
correct files added with wrong CRLF/LF line endings. This
option <br>
implies -u.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--chmod=(+|-)x <br>
Override the executable bit of the added files. The
executable bit <br>
is only changed in the index, the files on disk are left
unchanged.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pathspec-from-file=&lt;file&gt;
<br>
Pathspec is passed in &lt;file&gt; instead of commandline
args. If &lt;file&gt; <br>
is exactly - then standard input is used. Pathspec elements
are <br>
separated by LF or CR/LF. Pathspec elements can be quoted as
<br>
explained for the configuration variable core.quotePath (see
git- <br>
config(1)). See also --pathspec-file-nul and global <br>
--literal-pathspecs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pathspec-file-nul <br>
Only meaningful with --pathspec-from-file. Pathspec elements
are <br>
separated with NUL character and all other characters are
taken <br>
literally (including newlines and quotes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- <br>
This option can be used to separate command-line options
from the <br>
list of files, (useful when filenames might be mistaken for
<br>
command-line options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
&acirc;&cent; Adds content from all *.txt files under
Documentation directory and <br>
its subdirectories:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git add Documentation/txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the asterisk * is
quoted from the shell in this example; <br>
this lets the command include the files from subdirectories
of <br>
Documentation/ directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;&cent; Considers adding
content from all git-*.sh scripts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git add git-*.sh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because this example lets the
shell expand the asterisk (i.e. you <br>
are listing the files explicitly), it does not consider <br>
subdir/git-foo.sh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERACTIVE MODE <br>
When the command enters the interactive mode, it shows the
output of <br>
the status subcommand, and then goes into its interactive
command loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command loop shows the list
of subcommands available, and gives a <br>
prompt &quot;What now&gt; &quot;. In general, when the
prompt ends with a single &gt;, <br>
you can pick only one of the choices given and type return,
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*** Commands *** <br>
1: status 2: update 3: revert 4: add untracked <br>
5: patch 6: diff 7: quit 8: help <br>
What now&gt; 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You also could say s or sta or
status above as long as the choice is <br>
unique.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main command loop has 6
subcommands (plus help and quit).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status <br>
This shows the change between HEAD and index (i.e. what will
be <br>
committed if you say git commit), and between index and
working <br>
tree files (i.e. what you could stage further before git
commit <br>
using git add) for each path. A sample output looks like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">staged unstaged path <br>
1: binary nothing foo.png <br>
2: +403/-35 +1/-1 git-add--interactive.perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It shows that foo.png has
differences from HEAD (but that is binary <br>
so line count cannot be shown) and there is no difference
between <br>
indexed copy and the working tree version (if the working
tree <br>
version were also different, binary would have been shown in
place <br>
of nothing). The other file, git-add--interactive.perl, has
403 <br>
lines added and 35 lines deleted if you commit what is in
the <br>
index, but working tree file has further modifications (one
<br>
addition and one deletion).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update <br>
This shows the status information and issues an
&quot;Update&gt;&gt;&quot; prompt. <br>
When the prompt ends with double &gt;&gt;, you can make more
than one <br>
selection, concatenated with whitespace or comma. Also you
can say <br>
ranges. E.g. &quot;2-5 7,9&quot; to choose 2,3,4,5,7,9 from
the list. If the <br>
second number in a range is omitted, all remaining patches
are <br>
taken. E.g. &quot;7-&quot; to choose 7,8,9 from the list.
You can say * to <br>
choose everything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What you chose are then
highlighted with *, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">staged unstaged path <br>
1: binary nothing foo.png <br>
* 2: +403/-35 +1/-1 git-add--interactive.perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To remove selection, prefix the
input with - like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Update&gt;&gt; -2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After making the selection,
answer with an empty line to stage the <br>
contents of working tree files for selected paths in the
index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">revert <br>
This has a very similar UI to update, and the staged
information <br>
for selected paths are reverted to that of the HEAD version.
<br>
Reverting new paths makes them untracked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add untracked <br>
This has a very similar UI to update and revert, and lets
you add <br>
untracked paths to the index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">patch <br>
This lets you choose one path out of a status like
selection. After <br>
choosing the path, it presents the diff between the index
and the <br>
working tree file and asks you if you want to stage the
change of <br>
each hunk. You can select one of the following options and
type <br>
return:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">y - stage this hunk <br>
n - do not stage this hunk <br>
q - quit; do not stage this hunk or any of the remaining
ones <br>
a - stage this hunk and all later hunks in the file <br>
d - do not stage this hunk or any of the later hunks in the
file <br>
g - select a hunk to go to <br>
/ - search for a hunk matching the given regex <br>
j - leave this hunk undecided, see next undecided hunk <br>
J - leave this hunk undecided, see next hunk <br>
k - leave this hunk undecided, see previous undecided hunk
<br>
K - leave this hunk undecided, see previous hunk <br>
s - split the current hunk into smaller hunks <br>
e - manually edit the current hunk <br>
? - print help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After deciding the fate for all
hunks, if there is any hunk that <br>
was chosen, the index is updated with the selected
hunks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can omit having to type
return here, by setting the <br>
configuration variable interactive.singleKey to true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff <br>
This lets you review what will be committed (i.e. between
HEAD and <br>
index).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EDITING PATCHES <br>
Invoking git add -e or selecting e from the interactive hunk
selector <br>
will open a patch in your editor; after the editor exits,
the result is <br>
applied to the index. You are free to make arbitrary changes
to the <br>
patch, but note that some changes may have confusing
results, or even <br>
result in a patch that cannot be applied. If you want to
abort the <br>
operation entirely (i.e., stage nothing new in the index),
simply <br>
delete all lines of the patch. The list below describes some
common <br>
things you may see in a patch, and which editing operations
make sense <br>
on them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">added content <br>
Added content is represented by lines beginning with
&quot;+&quot;. You can <br>
prevent staging any addition lines by deleting them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">removed content <br>
Removed content is represented by lines beginning with
&quot;-&quot;. You can <br>
prevent staging their removal by converting the
&quot;-&quot; to a &quot; &quot; <br>
(space).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modified content <br>
Modified content is represented by &quot;-&quot; lines
(removing the old <br>
content) followed by &quot;+&quot; lines (adding the
replacement content). <br>
You can prevent staging the modification by converting
&quot;-&quot; lines to <br>
&quot; &quot;, and removing &quot;+&quot; lines. Beware that
modifying only half of the <br>
pair is likely to introduce confusing changes to the
index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are also more complex
operations that can be performed. But <br>
beware that because the patch is applied only to the index
and not the <br>
working tree, the working tree will appear to
&quot;undo&quot; the change in the <br>
index. For example, introducing a new line into the index
that is in <br>
neither the HEAD nor the working tree will stage the new
line for <br>
commit, but the line will appear to be reverted in the
working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Avoid using these constructs, or
do so with extreme caution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">removing untouched content <br>
Content which does not differ between the index and working
tree <br>
may be shown on context lines, beginning with a &quot;
&quot; (space). You <br>
can stage context lines for removal by converting the space
to a <br>
&quot;-&quot;. The resulting working tree file will appear
to re-add the <br>
content.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modifying existing content <br>
One can also modify context lines by staging them for
removal (by <br>
converting &quot; &quot; to &quot;-&quot;) and adding a
&quot;+&quot; line with the new content. <br>
Similarly, one can modify &quot;+&quot; lines for existing
additions or <br>
modifications. In all cases, the new modification will
appear <br>
reverted in the working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new content <br>
You may also add new content that does not exist in the
patch; <br>
simply add new lines, each starting with &quot;+&quot;. The
addition will <br>
appear reverted in the working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are also several
operations which should be avoided entirely, as <br>
they will make the patch impossible to apply:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;&cent; adding context
(&quot; &quot;) or removal (&quot;-&quot;) lines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;&cent; deleting context
or removal lines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;&cent; modifying the
contents of context or removal lines</p>
